# Tri-State Hydroseeding Field App

## Project Overview

This field app helps Tri-State Hydroseeding employees find locations on project plans, ensure proper installation of products, measure areas, and log project activity. It is designed to streamline field operations for erosion control, hydroseeding, and Highway DOT repair projects.

## Key Features

- **Project Stationing:** 
  - Supports highway/dot-style stationing (e.g., 12+45.67 = 1,245.67 ft from 0+00).
  - Converts between stations, feet, and miles.
  - Handles offsets (LT/RT) for location reference.
  - Supports curves, station equations, and quarter stations.

- **Location Mapping:** 
  - Find and mark locations on uploaded project plans.
  - Calibrate start and finish points to match plan station numbers.

- **Area Measurement:** 
  - Measure by square yards or acres.

- **Material Tracking & Activity Log:** 
  - Assign required materials to specific station points.
  - Log installation activity and progress.
  - Weekly progress reports.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required dependencies (see instructions below).
3. Follow usage guidance to begin adding projects and marking field locations.

## Usage Concepts

- **Stationing/Chainage:** Distance along a baseline; 1 station = 100 feet.
- **Offsets:** LT (left), RT (right) of centerline.
- **Curves:** PI (intersection), PC (curve start), PT (curve end).
- **Station Equations:** For handling jumps/gaps in numbering.

## Planned Features

- Upload project plan files.
- Calibrate station start/finish.
- Issue pinpoints for material assignments.
- Log field activity and generate progress reports.
